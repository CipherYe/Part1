        At the University of Surrey, I chose the similar position as my undergraduate did. In the face of uncertain learning pressures in this year, I can guarantee the quality of my work with less effort. Due to high mobility of university societies,
        in addition to completing the contact with the sponsor, I also need to provide simple training to students who have just been exposed to this type of work, so that they can adapt to the Outreach Department more quickly.
